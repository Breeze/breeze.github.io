                <p>Breeze is a library for rich client applications written in HTML and JavaScript.</p>
                <p>It concentrates on the challenge of building and maintaining highly responsive, data-intensive applications in which users search, add, update, and view complex data from different angles as they pursue solutions to real problems in real time.</p>
                <p>Features include:</p>
                <p><strong>Rich queries</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Write simple and complex queries using a&nbsp;LINQ-like query syntax:
                        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                            <li>
                                Simple conditions (id == 42, amount &gt; 100, name starts with “Bob”)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Compound conditions (name is “Bob” or “Robert”)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Conditions with functions (length(name) &gt; 30)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Conditions on related entities (customers with orders shipped to California)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Sort, page, take first ‘n’
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Expand the query result to include related entities in the payload (eager loading)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Select a subset of properties; flatten complex object graphs with projections
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                        Use the same query object and query language to filter entities in the local cache.
                    </li>
