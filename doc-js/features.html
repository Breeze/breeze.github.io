#Features
Breeze is a library for rich client applications written in HTML and JavaScript.
It concentrates on the challenge of building and maintaining highly responsive, data-intensive applications in which users search, add, update, and view complex data from different angles as they pursue solutions to real problems in real time.
Features include:
**Rich queries**
<ul>
	<li>
		Write simple and complex queries using a LINQ-like query syntax:
		<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
			<li>
				Simple conditions (id == 42, amount > 100, name starts with "Bob")
			<li>
				Compound conditions (name is "Bob" or "Robert")
			<li>
				Conditions with functions (length(name) > 30)
			<li>
				Conditions on related entities (customers with orders shipped to California)
			<li>
				Sort, page, take first 'n'
			<li>
				Expand the query result to include related entities in the payload (eager loading)
			<li>
				Select a subset of properties; flatten complex object graphs with projections
		</ul>
	
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>
		Query a remote service with a full OData-compliant URL.
	<li>
		Merges query results into cache, adding new entities and updating others while preserving unsaved changes.
	<li>
		Use the same query object and query language to filter entities in the local cache.
</ul>
**Client-side caching**
<ul>
	<li>
		Caching entities locally on the JavaScript client.
	<li>
		Navigation among entities in cache, e.g., *Customer *to *Orders *to *OrderDetails *to *Product *... and back.
</ul>
**Change tracking**
<ul>
	<li>
		Entities are self-tracking; they know when they are new, changed, marked-for-delete, or unchanged.
	<li>
		Refresh an entity to its current state on the server or revert changed entities to their original values with a single command.
	<li>
		Publishes property-changed and other notifications about the entities that enter, leave, and change in cache.
</ul>
**Validation**
<ul>
	<li>
		Validates entire entities and individual property values, automatically or on-demand, with a combination of discovered and custom rules.
	<li>
		Validation error messages can be customized or localized.
</ul>
**Pluggable back-end**
<ul>
	<li>
		Full integration with the Entity Framework.
	<li>
		Supports WebAPI and OData back-ends.
	<li>
		Works with NoSQL, non-.NET, and SOA back-ends. *(Samples under development.)*
</ul>
**Data management**
<ul>
	<li>
		Create entities dynamically based on metadata that you control and extend.
	<li>
		Id generation strategies handle a wide variety of client and store-generated key schemes; use ours or write your own.
	<li>
		Export and reimport entities to device local storage to meet offline and reliability requirements.
	<li>
		Create multiple caches to segment and isolate data changes in "sandboxes".
	<li>
		Combine entities from multiple remote services in the same cache.
	<li>
		All service operations return JavaScript promises.
	<li>
		Entities support Complex Types and Enumerations as properties.
</ul>
**Batched saves**
<ul>
	<li>
		Save pending changes to a remote service in a single request.
	<li>
		Mix entities of different types in the same change-set (Customers, Orders, OrderDetails).
	<li>
		Mix operations (add, update, delete) in the same change-set.
	<li>
		Save the change-set as a single transaction.
	<li>
		Detect and resolve concurrency conflicts.
</ul>
**Library and Tooling support**
<ul>
	<li>
		Out-of-box support for Knockout, Angular, and Backbone.
	<li>
		TypeScript support for compile-time type checking, classes, interfaces, and inheritance.
	<li>
		IntelliSense support for Visual Studio 2012.
	<li>
		RequireJS-enabled for modular applications.
	<li>
		Open API that allows additional front or back-ends to be plugged in.
</ul>
**Supported by IdeaBlade**
<ul>
	<li>
		Developed and supported by IdeaBlade, since 2001 a leader in rich client application libraries.
	<li>
		Extensive API documentation with examples and links to source code.
	<li>
		Quality control through QUnit automated tests.
	<li>
		Paid support options, training, and consulting services to ensure that you succeed.
</ul>
