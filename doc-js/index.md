### Headline features - {{page.title}}

+ **Business data objects** mirror your server-side model. Breeze creates them dynamically. Their properties bind to UI controls so the UI updates when your data model changes. Each object knows when it has changed and what has changed.</p>

+ **Query** in a JavaScript query language with filtering, projection, ordering, and paging. 

+ **Save** one entity or a batch of entities as a single transaction. Batch a mix of entity types (customers, orders, line-items) and data operations (inserts, updates, deletes). 

+ **Cache** data on the client to reduce trips to the server and refresh as needed. Query the cache like you query the server. Save the cache locally and run offline; synch changes when you're reconnected. 

+ **Extend** the model with custom methods, properties, and events. Breeze is designed with adapters at the boundaries so you can plug into your favorite front-end and back-end technologies.
