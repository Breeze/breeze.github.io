# Coding and API conventions

The Breeze client components adhere to a small number of conventions that cut across the entire API. The page describing those conventions is not ready for publication. It will cover:

- Naming conventions

- *Promises*, a technique for managing chains of asynchronous method calls

- Why Breeze properties do not have setters and you should call *setProperty* instead

- *Enum*, Breeze constants as rich, extensible objects

- *Event*, publish and subscribe in Breeze

- Breeze client configuration options

- Bypassing the entity property API to get and set data values
