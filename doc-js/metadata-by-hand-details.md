#Metadata by hand ... in depth#

The related topic [**"Metadata by Hand"**](/doc-js/metadata-by-hand) is an introduction to writing your own metadata in JavaScript rather than depending on the server to generate it for you.  It tell you all you need to know about writing metadata for your model.

**This topic goes deeper into the details**. It covers more of the options. It explains in greater depth what is going on and the relationship between the Breeze Labs MetadataHelper and the native Breeze metadata format.

> The code shown in this topic is adapted from <i><a href="https://github.com/IdeaBlade/Breeze/blob/master/Samples/DocCode/DocCode/tests/helpers/metadataOnClient.js" title="metadataOnClient.js source code" target="_blank">metadataOnClient.js</a></i>&nbsp;  in the <a href="/doc-samples/doccode" title="DocCode sample">Breeze "DocCode" sample</a>. Try that sample to explore Breeze in general and metadata in particular through the medium of QUnit tests.

##Why "by hand?"##
The Breeze client needs metadata *to make entity data work for you*: to compose queries, identify objects by key, navigate to related entities, track changed state, raise property-changed events, validate data entry, and serialize entities to the server or local storage.

Whenever you query the server, Breeze uses metadata to identify entity data in the response and merge those data safely into cache. Whenever you write `manager.createEntity('Foo')`, Breeze uses metadata to construct a new instance of the `Foo` entity type.

If your application server implements the OData standard, Breeze (usually) can get the metadata it needs with a request to the $metadata endpoint. If your application server relies on the .NET Entity Framework ORM to access the database, Breeze.NET components can generate the Breeze client metadata for you.

Sometimes you're not that fortunate. Perhaps you can't touch the server (as illustrated by the "[Edmunds Auto Service](/doc-samples/edmunds "Edmunds Auto Service")" sample). Perhaps your server can't generate the metadata (see the [Ruby on Rails](/doc-samples/intro-to-spa-ruby "Code Camper Jumpstart in Ruby on Rails") and [Node/MongoDb](/doc-samples/zza-mongo "Zza Node/MongoDb sample") samples). You won't be able to get metadata from the server.

> If you're a .NET developer with access to the server side data model classes, you can use Entity Framework *as a  metadata generator*, as a design-time-only tool,  even if you won't use EF to access data in production. [We describe this technique elsewhere](/doc-js/metadata-with-ef "EF as a Metadata Design Tool"). 

**You don't have to get the metadata from the server**.  Breeze metadata on the client is just JavaScript. You can write that JavaScript metadata yourself ... as we'll see here.

#How?#
We'll dedicate a JavaScript file to a module that creates a [MetadataStore](/doc-js/api-docs/classes/MetadataStore.html "MetadataStore API") populated with metadata describing the entity types returned by an HTTP service. 

Then we'll create a new [EntityManager](/doc-js/api-docs/classes/EntityManager.html "EntityManager API") that uses this metadataStore and show that the manager can create and query entities just fine without requesting metadata from the server.

A Breeze `MetadataStore` has several parts. The most important is its collection of `EntityTypes` and creating that collection is the primary focus of this topic.

An [EntityType](/doc-js/api-docs/classes/EntityType.html "EntityType API") has several important sub-parts that we'll define by hand:

- Header info (e.g, the name)
- Data properties
- Navigation properties
- Validators

Breeze has API methods for defining each of these sub-parts separately. We could build up the metadata by calling each method separately. That works ... but is more verbose than the approach we'll demonstrate here.

#Learn by example#

Let's create a `MetadataStore` for a three-entity model consisting of `Product`, `Category`, and `Supplier` types.  A `Product` belongs to a `Category` and has a single `Supplier`.

The model will map exactly, property-for-column, to three  tables of the well-known <a href="http://northwinddatabase.codeplex.com/" title="Northwind Database" target="_blank">Northwind database</a>.

<img alt="Product/Supplier/Categories ERD" src="/images/ProductCategorySupplierERD.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 616px;">

>Such close correspondence is typical but it isn't necessary. What matters more is that the client model align with the data structures returned in HTTP response payloads.

The model has a wrinkle. The `Supplier` address properties (`Address`, `City`, `Region`, `PostalCode`, and `Country`) are represented collectively within a single `location` property that returns a [ComplexType](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/bb738472(v=vs.100).aspx "ComplexType"). To learn the supplier's city we'd write `supplier.location.city` instead of `supplier.city`.

We'll need a bit of setup:

    // Convenience variables
    var DT = breeze.DataType;
    var Identity = breeze.AutoGeneratedKeyType.Identity;
    var Validator = breeze.Validator;
    var camelCaseConvention = breeze.NamingConvention.camelCase;
  
    var serviceName = 'breeze/Northwind'; // root path for data from the server
    var defaultNamespace = 'Northwind.Models';

    // Breeze Labs: breeze.metadata.helper.js
    var helper = new breeze.config.MetadataHelper(defaultNamespace);
    var addTypeToStore = helper.addTypeToStore.bind(helper);

This is mostly boilerplate. 

- We set some variables that make it more convenient to access frequently referenced Breeze objects.
 
- We set two variables with application-specific magic strings (we'll explain the default namespace <a href="#namespace">below</a>).

- We create an instance of the **Breeze Labs `MetadataHelper` class** whose functions spare us some cumbersome syntax and much of the error prone repetition that would otherwise mar our metadata writing experience. 

> **The helper saves a lot of time and heartache** and is strongly recommended. It is <a href="#addTypeToStore"><strong>described in detail below</strong></a>.</p>

We're ready to write the function that creates our handwritten `MetadataStore`:

    // Creates a metadataStore with 3 Northwind EntityTypes:
    // Product, Category, Supplier and a Location ComplexType
    function createMetadataStore(serviceName) {
    
        var store = new breeze.MetadataStore({
            namingConvention: breeze.NamingConvention.camelCase
        });
    
        helper.addDataService(store, serviceName);
    
        // Add types in alphabetical order ... because we can
        addCategoryType(store);
        addLocationComplexType(store);
        addProductType(store);
        addSupplierType(store);
    
        return store;
    }


Now use it to create an `EntityManager` and execute a query.

    var store = createMetadataStore(serviceName);
    
    var manager = new breeze.EntityManager({
                serviceName: serviceName,
                metadataStore: store
            });
    
    breeze.EntityQuery.from("Category")
          .using(manager).execute().then(function(data){
              alert("Got "+ data.results.length + " 'Category' entities");
           });

Let's dig into the `createMetadataStore` method.

## Naming Convention

We must tell our `MetadataStore` what [NamingConvention](/doc-js/server-namingconvention "NamingConvention") to use before adding entity types. 


    var store = new breeze.MetadataStore({
        namingConvention: breeze.NamingConvention.camelCase
    });

A `NamingConvention` coverts between the spelling of server property name and the spelling of client property names when serializing and deserializing entity data on the wire.

We configured the new `MetadataStore` to use the [camelCase NamingConvention](/doc-js/api-docs/classes/NamingConvention.html#property_camelCase "camelCase NamingConvention") because we know that the server expects property names to be in PascalCase (e.g., ProductName) while we prefer the camelCase property names that are customary in JavaScript code. We could have written a custom `NamingConvention` if our server followed some other standard such as the lowercase-underline-heavy convention of Ruby on Rails apps.

Regardless of backend, we specify **client-oriented property names** in our hand coded metadata, and rely on the `NamingConvention` to translate to server-side property names.

## Specify the DataService 
The Breeze [DataService](/doc-js/api-docs/classes/DataService.html "DataService API") specifies details about the remote server associated with this metadata. It's most important (and only essential) property is its `serviceName` which identifies the root path to the remote server.

    store.addDataService(
        new breeze.DataService({ serviceName: 'breeze/Northwind' }
    );

> You would add another `DataService` if you needed this same metadataStore to work with a second remote server at a different address.

And now we're ready to add the entity types, starting with a simple example

# Define the Category type

Let's look at some code and then break it down:

    // Definition of a simple reference type
    function addCategoryType(store) {
        var et = {
            // Header info
            shortName: "Category",
            namespace: defaultNamespace,
            autoGeneratedKeyType: Identity, 
            defaultResourceName: "Categories",
            
            dataProperties: {
                categoryID:   { dataType: DT.Int32, isPartOfKey: true },
                categoryName: { maxLength: 4000 }, // DT.String is the default type
                description:  { maxLength: 4000 },
                picture:      { dataType: DT.Binary, maxLength: 4000},
                rowVersion:   { dataType: DT.Int32, isNullable: false },
            }
        };
    
        return addTypeToStore(store, et);
    }

We're creating a big configuration object, `et` (short for "EntityType"), and then passing it to some function that purportedly creates the `Category` entity type from that config and adds it to the metadataStore (the `store`). We'll get to that function in due time. 

## Header information
The config object begins with some "header info", followed by a list of data properties. Let's tackle the "header" first.

<a name="namespace"></a>

### Naming the type

The `shortName` is the familiar name of the type, "Category".  

The `namespace` value identifies the namespace of the "Category" class as it is known on the server-side model, a string such as "Northwind.Models". 

> Because we'll use the same `namespace` throughout our model definition, we've captured it in the variable `northwindNamespace`.

The namespace value matters if it matters to the backend; if the backend doesn't care (e.g. Rails or Node), then it can be anything as long *as the client and the server agree on the same value*.

In principle we could have two `Category` types in the metadata as long as they had different namespaces. Accordingly, what uniquely identifies an entity type is its full `name` - the `EntityType.name` - which is the `shortName` + the "**:#**" separator characters + the `namespace`. The full `name` of our `Category` type is "Category:#Northwind.Models".

It's tedious and error prone to have to write the namespace over and over, especially when this model (like most models) only has one namespace. We'll omit the namespace specification from now on and leave it to the MetadataHelper (`helper`) to apply the `defaultNamespace` when the time comes.

### Key generation

How will the system assign a key when we create a new `Category` entity instance? Should the client assign the key value? Or will the key be assigned on the server (e.g., by the data tier)?  

Breeze supports the three choices in the [AutoGeneratedKeyType](/doc-js/api-docs/classes/AutoGeneratedKeyType.html "AutoGeneratedKeyType enum API") enumeration:

1. `None` - the client assigns the key value (default)

2. `Identity` - the key properties map to identity columns in a database table; the database generates the key value.

3. `KeyGenerator`- the key value is assigned on the server by some form of custom key generation scheme. You'll have to register a JavaScript [key generation function](/doc-js/api-docs/classes/~keyGenerator_interface.html "Custom KeyGenerator interface") with the `EntityManager` to maintain temporary keys on the client. 

Most entity keys are either client assigned (`None` - the default) or `Identity`. All three of our model types have `Identity` keys.

You can change the default for your model either by specifying it in the helper constructor

    var defaultKeyGen = breeze.AutoGeneratedKeyType.Identity;
    var helper = new breeze.config.MetaDataHelper(defaultNamespace, defaultKeyGen);

or by setting it explicitly

    helper.setDefaultAutoGeneratedKeyType(defaultKeyGen);

### Default ResourceName

The `defaultResourceName` should be the **resource name** of the server endpoint that you target most frequently with queries for this type.

The `defaultResourceName` is typically the plural form of the type name (e.g., "Categories") because that's where most people go to "get all" instances of the type. 

For example, if I want to get all `Category` entities, I'll  probably write a Breeze query like this one:

    var query = breeze.EntityQuery.from("Categories");

Notice that you can't tell what type of objects this query returns unless you know that the resource name in the `from("Categories")` clause is associated with the `Category` type.

Breeze doesn't *always* have to know the query return type. It usually can figure that out from the response data. But sometimes breeze needs to know the type ***before*** it can process the query ... as it must when executing this query against the local cache.

So give Breeze a hand by specifying a good default resource name. Later will learn how to tell Breeze with metadata about other ResourceName-to-EntityType associations.

## DataProperties

Breeze metadata describe two kinds of properties: a **`Navigation`** property for getting and setting related entities and a **`DataProperty`** for getting and setting other kinds of values.

The `Category` type doesn't have navigation properties. Although there is a relationship between `Product` and `Category` and you can navigate from a product to its category (`Product.category`, <a href="#Product_category">described below</a>), we opted to omit the navigation property from category to product.

> This is an application modeling decision of the kind you'll make for your own model.

`Category` does have data properties, each of them an instance of the Breeze `DataProperty` class. The `DataProperty` attributes describe many important characteristics of the property such as:

* its **`name`** in the client model (which differ from its name on the server). [required]

* its [DataType](/doc-js/api-docs/classes/DataType.html "DataType API") [defaults to `String`]

* if it is the entity key or [part of the key](/doc-js/api-docs/classes/DataProperty.html#property_isPartOfKey "DataProperty.isPartOfKey API") [defaults to `false`]

* if it is required or [isNullable](/doc-js/api-docs/classes/DataProperty.html#property_isNullable "DataProperty.isNullable API") [defaults to `false`]

* if its value has a [maximum length](/doc-js/api-docs/classes/DataProperty.html#property_maxLength "DataProperty.maxLength API") [optional]

Our `Category` configuration  defines a `DataProperties` hash object whose keys are the type's client-side property names and whose values prescribe one or more of those `DataProperty` attributes.

    dataProperties: {
       categoryID:   { dataType: DT.Int32, isPartOfKey: true },
       categoryName: { maxLength: 4000 }, // DT.String is the default DataType
       description:  { maxLength: 4000 },
       picture:      { dataType: DT.Binary, maxLength: 4000},
    }

You can specify every attribute explicitly or accept the defaults as we have done here.

> For brevity we captured the `breeze.DataType` enumeration in a variable named `DT` earlier in the code-base.

A `DataProperty` also holds a collection of [Validators](/doc-js/api-docs/classes/Validator.html "Validator API"). We could add validators here while we're defining each property. Instead, we'll <a href="#inferValidators">generate some validators</a> a little later in our program.

Check out the **[DataProperty API docs](/doc-js/api-docs/classes/DataProperty.html "DataProperty API")** for the full story on `DataProperty` attributes.

## Add Category to the store

We've completed the configuration object for the `Category` type. We're ready to create the type and add it to the `MetadataStore` ... which our code does by calling a helper function

    return et = addTypeToStore(store, et)

We'll delve into that function <a href= "#addTypeToStore">later in our story</a>. Let's skip ahead to the definition of the `Product` type where we'll learn about navigation properties.

#Define the Product type#

We follow the same course when defining the `Product` entity type. Here's a somewhat abbreviated version of the `addProductType` method.

><a href="#ProductRevisited">Later in this topic</a> you'll learn how to define this type a bit more concisely.

    function addProductType(store) {
        var et = {
            shortName: "Product",
            autoGeneratedKeyType: Identity, 
            defaultResourceName: "Products",
    
            dataProperties: {
                productID:       { dataType: DT.Int32, isPartOfKey: true },
                productName:     { maxLength: 40 },
                supplierID:      { dataType: DT.Int32} ,
                categoryID:      { dataType: DT.Int32 },
                unitPrice:       { dataType: DT.Decimal },
                unitsInStock:    { dataType: DT.Int16 },
                discontinued:    { dataType: DT.Boolean, isNullable: false },
                discontinuedDate:{ dataType: DT.DateTime },
                // other properties
            },
    
            navigationProperties: {
                category: {
                    entityTypeName: "Category",
                    associationName: "Product_Category",
                    foreignKeyNames: ["categoryID"] 
                },
                supplier: {
                    entityTypeName: "Supplier",
                    associationName: "Supplier_Products",
                    foreignKeyNames: ["supplierID"] 
                },
            }
        };
    
        return addTypeToStore(store, et);
    }
  
The `dataProperties` definition illustrates a few of the other [DataTypes](/doc-js/api-docs/classes/DataType.html "DataType API") that Breeze supports.

Our attention turns to a new subject, the **navigation properties**.

<a name="NavigationProperties"></a>

## Navigation Properties

A **[NavigationProperty](/doc-js/api-docs/classes/NavigationProperty.html "NavigationProperty API")** describes an entity property that returns a related entity (or collection of entities) from the `EntityManager` cache.

<a name="Product_category"></a>

The `Product` type has two navigation properties, `Product.category` and `Product.supplier`. Here are their definitions again:

    navigationProperties: {
        category: {
            entityTypeName: "Category",
            associationName: "Product_Category",
            foreignKeyNames: ["categoryID"] 
        },
        supplier: {
            entityTypeName: "Supplier",
            associationName: "Supplier_Products",
            foreignKeyNames: ["supplierID"] 
        },
    }

We're showing three of the four critical attributes for these navigation properties:

* `entityTypeName` - the name of the type returned by the property

* `associationName` - a name that links this navigation property to a corresponding navigation property on the other side that points back to this object.

* `foreignKeyNames` - the name of the property **in this type** that holds the foreign key value.

* `isScalar` - whether this navigation returns a single entity object (`true`) or a collection (`false`). Because these two properties each return a single entity  (or `null`), we can omit the `isScalar` attribute and accept the default value (`true`)

The first three attributes deserve a few more words of explanation.

### entityTypeName

This required attribute identifies another entity type registered in the `metadataStore`. We must supply the full type name. For example, we should have written:

    entityTypeName: "Category:#Northwind.Models"

We cheated. We'll get away with it because we'll later call the <a href= "#addTypeToStore">addTypeToStore</a> which will patch in the missing namespace for us. 

> Why cheat? We'll explain when we discuss that function. Just know (a) that you'll need to specify the full name and (b) you don't have to cheat if you don't want to.

### associationName
This model has one association between `Product` and `Supplier` ("Supplier_Products") and another association between `Product` and  `Category` ("Product_Category"). 

> These names are conventional and somewhat arbitrary. It doesn't matter which entity type name comes first. In fact, the name itself doesn't matter at all. You could call it "Association#1" if you like.

The "Supplier_Products" association happens to be bi-directional. There is a `Product.supplier` navigation and an "inverse" `Supplier.products` navigation.

The "Product_Category" association happens to be unidirectional. There is only a `Product.category` navigation; there is no inverse `Category.products` navigation property.

When an association is bi-directional, Breeze needs to know about both navigation properties. For example, if we assign a product to a supplier, Breeze must update *both* the product's `supplier` property *and* add this product to the supplier's `products` collection. It's Breeze's job to keep both sides in-sync.

Breeze knows that two navigation properties are related by association when they have the same `associationName`. The actual name doesn't matter. They just have to be the same for both navigation properties.

<a name="foreignKeyNames"></a>

###foreignKeyNames

The `foreignKeyNames` is an array of property names that identify the foreign key properties in this entity that help Breeze implement the association. Usually there is only one foreign key property and thus only one name in the array. 

> Breeze asks for an array in anticipation of the possibility that the association requires a compound foreign key.

Breeze needs foreign keys to maintain associations between two related entities. If you set the a cached product's `categoryID` to "42", Breeze looks in cache for a `Category` with that ID and, if it finds one, it updates the product's `category` navigation property accordingly.

The same thing happens when you retrieve a `Product` from the server.  You don't have to include the related `Category` in the query response; Breeze fills in the `category` property automatically. This is what we mean when we say Breeze offers "***self-assembling object graphs***".

Your model entities must have foreign keys if you want Breeze perform these services. 

### Supplier.products

We've seen two navigation properties leading from `Product` to two other entity types, `Category` and `Supplier`. What about the "inverse" navigations back to `Product`.

`Category` doesn't have one; it could have had a `Category.products` but we decide to omit it for some reason (perhaps good reasons).

`Supplier` does have an inverse navigation property, `Supplier.products`. Its "Supplier_Products" association is bi-directional. 

We'll see how to define that navigation property when we discuss the `Supplier` type ... next.

# Define the Supplier type
In the `Supplier` type we'll learn how to

* define a navigation property returning a collection of related entities.
* decorate the type and a property with custom metadata information
* encapsulate some properties within a `ComplexType`
* add a validator to a property inside the metadata

Here's a slightly abbreviated look at the `addSupplierType` function:


    function addSupplierType(store) {
        var et = {
            shortName: "Supplier",
            autoGeneratedKeyType: Identity, 
            defaultResourceName: "Suppliers",
    
            custom: {style: "bold", meaningOfLife: 42},
    
            dataProperties: {
                supplierID:   { dataType: DT.Int32, isPartOfKey: true },
                companyName:  { maxLength: 40, isNullable: false, custom: {uiHint:"big"} },
                location:     { complexTypeName: "Location", isNullable: false},
                phone:        { maxLength: 24 , validators: [ Validator.phone() ] },       
                // ... other properties
            },
    
            navigationProperties: {
                products: {
                    entityTypeName: "Product",
                    isScalar: false,
                    associationName: "Supplier_Products"
                }
            }
        };
    
        return addTypeToStore(store, et);
    }

## The "products" collection navigation property

The `Supplier.products` property is the inverse of the `Product.supplier` navigation on the `Product` type. It's the flip side of the "Supplier_Products" association and we know that because both navigation properties share the same `associationName`.

It differs from `Product.supplier` in two ways.

1. This direction is one-to-many; a `Supplier` has many products. The `products` property returns a collection of `Product` entities. Therefore, we set the `isScalar` attribute to `false`.

1. We don't need to identify the foreign keys supporting the association.
 
The latter point bears explaining. 

Breeze associations must be supported by foreign keys if Breeze is to do the work of maintaining the navigation properties as we <a href="#foreignKeyNames">explained above</a>.

One of the association navigation properties must identify the foreign keys. The `Product.supplier` property took care of that already. We don't have to repeat that information in the `Supplier.products` property.

>We would have to code this navigation property a little differently if there were no `Product.supplier` property; <a href="#invForeignKeyNames">see below</a> for details.

## Custom metadata

The `MetadataStore` holds a lot of useful information about each entity type in the model and that information is pretty easy to access at runtime. First you fish out the type of interest.

    var type = manager.metadataStore.getEntityType('Category);

Then you drill into its properties until you find what you want.

Wouldn't it be grand if you could supplement the Breeze metadata with your own metadata? Then there would be a single place to find everything about a type.

Technically, this being JavaScript, you can extend any object by simply assigning a property to it. No one can stop you from tacking an arbitrary object onto a `MetadataStore`.

Please don't do that. You'll miss out on Breeze's ability to export and import metadata ... because Breeze only exports metadata properties that it recognizes.

Fortunately, Breeze recognizes a metadata attribute called `custom` and you can assign it with anything you want ... as long as that thing can be `JSON.stringified` for export/import.

Suppose we are fans of "Model Driven Architecture" and we intend to generate portions of the UI based on metadata associated with our model object properties. We might have "UI Hints" that tell the UI builder to display instances of certain types in bold colors. Maybe the "companyName" should appear in a large font. 

We *could* store these hints in a private application registry. But it's so much easier and more obvious to stash them in `custom` attributes of the `MetadataStore`.

The `Supplier` sample demonstrates two forms of `custom` metadata. There's custom information at the the entity level:

    custom: {style: "bold", meaningOfLife: 42}\

and custom information at the property level in `Supplier.companyName`:

Breeze itself ignores `custom` metadata attributes except when importing or exporting a 'MmetadataStore`. What you do with them is up to you. You can add or remove them any time. Breeze will include custom attributes when (and if) it [serializes metadata](/doc-js/api-docs/classes/MetadataStore.html#method_exportMetadata "Serialize metadata with the exportMetadata method").

## Complex types
The "Supplier" table has several columns that collectively describe the shipper's address.

We mapped those columns to the properties of a higher level construct called `Location` which is implemented as a [ComplexType](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/bb738472(v=vs.100).aspx "ComplexType") as we see in this extract of the data properties section.


    location:     { complexTypeName: "Location:#Northwind.Models", isNullable: false},
    
    /* if we didn't have Location ComplexType
    address:      { maxLength: 60 },
    city:         { maxLength: 15 },
    region:       { maxLength: 15 },
    postalCode:   { maxLength: 10 },
    country:      { maxLength: 15 },
    */

Now we can access the `city` property through the `Location`. Instead of writing `someSuppler.city` we can write `someSupplier.location.city`.

Of course we must also add the `Location` definition to the metadata. Here we've written an `addLocationComplexType`method for that purpose..

    function addLocationComplexType(store) {
        var et = {
            shortName: "Location",
            isComplexType: true,
    
            dataProperties: {
                address:    { maxLength: 60 },
                city:       { maxLength: 15 },
                region:     { maxLength: 15 },
                postalCode: { maxLength: 10 },
                country:    { maxLength: 15 },
            }
        };
    
        return et = addTypeToStore(store, et);
    } 

Writing a special `ComplexType` class and then replacing properties with this new type ...  seems like a lot of work. It doesn't seem worth doing just once. It might payoff if we could re-use the `Location` type elsewhere in the model.  

As it happens, the Northwind database has four tables ("Customer", "Employee", "Order", "Supplier") that have the same location properties. The four corresponding entity types are all candidates for the `Location` complex type treatment.

## Embed a property Validator

We typically [add Validators after](/doc-js/validation "Validation") the types have been registered. But you also can add Validators to a property definition while defining that property. The `Supplier.phone` is an example:

    dataProperties: {
        ...
        // example of embedding a validator in the metadata
        phone:        { maxLength: 24 , validators: [ breeze.Validator.phone() ] }, 
        ...       
    }

Notice that the data property has a `validators` array whose elements are instances of [the `Validator` class](/doc-js/api-docs/classes/Validator.html "Validator API").

# Add types to the MetadataStore

We'll use `addTypeToStore` to complete the process of defining metadata for our model.

> The `addTypeToStore` method and related helper functions are are ** part of core Breeze**. They belong to the Breeze Labs `MetadataHelper` extension defined in <em>breeze.metadata-helper.js</em>. <a href="https://github.com/IdeaBlade/Breeze/blob/master/Breeze.Client/Scripts/Labs/breeze.metadata-helper.js" target="_blank"><strong>Download it from GitHub</strong></a> and install it on your page <em>after loading breeze</em>.

So far we've created object hashes that describe three entity types - `Category`, `Product`, and `Supplier` - and one complex type, `Location`. Let's turn those hashes into Breeze types and add them to the `MetadataStore` using the `addTypeToStore` helper.

Create an instance of the helper at the top of your metadata creation script as we did

    var defaultNamespace = 'Northwind.Models';
    ...
    var helper = new breeze.config.MetadataHelper(defaultNamespace);
    var addTypeToStore = helper.addTypeToStore.bind(helper);

> `addTypeToStore` is only <i>one</i> way to achieve an efficient metadata writing workflow by conventions. That way may not suit your model or your preferred style. Please use as inspiration, not prescription.

With that caveat in mind, we'll continue describing the `addTypeToStore` and its supporting methods in the Breeze Labs *breeze.metadata-helper.js* script. 

    // Create the type from the definition hash and add the type to the store
    // fixes some defaults, infers certain validators,
    // add adds the type's "shortname" as a resource name
    function addTypeToStore(store, typeDef) {
        patchDefaults(typeDef);
        var type = typeDef.isComplexType ?
            new breeze.ComplexType(typeDef) :
            new breeze.EntityType(typeDef);
        store.addEntityType(type);
        inferValidators(type);
        addTypeNameAsResource(type);
    
        return type;
    }


There are five steps:

1. Tweak the type definition hash with some defaults that Breeze doesn't know about.

2. Create a type instance from the definition hash, either a `ComplexType` or an `EntityType`. We mostly create EntityTypes although we did create one ComplexType, `Location`, and used it within `Supplier`.

3. Add the type to the store with the Breeze `MetadataStore.addEntityType` method. Once you've done this, the type definition is "frozen" in many respects. You can't add more mapped properties, you can't add the same type again, and you can't remove a type once it's been added. Choose this moment wisely.

4. Infer some validators for each data property based on the property's data type and its nullability.
 
5. Tell breeze that the entity's own name is a valid "resource name" for local queries.

## patchDefaults

We strive to minimize the amount of configuration code.  Magic strings in hash objects are a necessary evil; anything we can do to reduce repetition and infer values improves readability and maintainability. So in our configurations above we've abbreviated or omitted some values that Breeze ultimately requires, trusting that we'll be able to fill the gaps later.

For example, Breeze requires all type names to include the namespace. Most models only have one namespace. In this code, you can omit the namespace and let `patchDefault` supply it later.

The time for "later" is now. The `patchDefault` method sweeps the configuration object, making eight fixes:

1. if the entity's namespace is missing, set it to the model's default namespace.
1. if the entity's key generation strategy is unspecified, use the model's default.
1. replace abbreviated attribute names with proper metadata attribute names (see below)
1. if a `ComplexType` property's type name lacks a namespace, add the entity's namespace. Ex: "*Location*" becomes "*Location:#Northwind.Model*".
1. assume a key property is required and set `isNullable=false` unless told otherwise.
1. convert the JSON representation of a validator into a `breeze.Validator` instance.
1. if a navigation property's return type name lacks a namespace, add the entity's namespace.  Ex: "*Category*" becomes "*Category:#Northwind.Model*" on the `Product.category` navigation.
1. coerce a foreign key specification into an array as required by breeze (see below).


Here is `patchDefaults` almost in its entirety:

    function patchDefaults(typeDef) {
        var key, prop;
        ...
        var typeName = typeDef.shortName;

        // if no namespace specified, assign the helper defaultNamespace 
        var namespace = typeDef.namespace = typeDef.namespace || this.defaultNamespace;

        if (!typeDef.isComplexType) {
            // if regular entityType lacks an autoGeneratedKeyType, use the helper defaultAutoGeneratedKeyType
            typeDef.autoGeneratedKeyType = typeDef.autoGeneratedKeyType || this.defaultAutoGeneratedKeyType;
        }

        var dps = typeDef.dataProperties;
        for (key in dps) {
            if (_hasOwnProperty(dps, key)) {
                prop = dps[key];
                this.replaceDataPropertyAbbreviations(prop);
                if (prop.complexTypeName && prop.complexTypeName.indexOf(":#") === -1) {
                    // if complexTypeName is unqualified, suffix with the entity's own namespace
                    prop.complexTypeName += ':#' + namespace;
                }
                // if key is named 'id' and isPartOfKey is null or undefined, infer isPartOfKey
                if (key.toLowerCase() === 'id' && prop.isPartOfKey == null) {
                    prop.isPartOfKey = true;
                }
                // assume key part is non-nullable ... unless explicitly declared nullable (when is that good?)
                prop.isNullable = prop.isNullable == null ? !prop.isPartOfKey : !!prop.isNullable;

                if (prop.validators) { this.convertValidators(typeName, key, prop); }
            }
        };

        var navs = typeDef.navigationProperties;
        for (key in navs) {
            if (_hasOwnProperty(navs, key)) {
                prop = navs[key];
                this.replaceNavPropertyAbbreviations(prop);
                if (prop.entityTypeName.indexOf(":#") === -1) {
                    // if name is unqualified, suffix with the entity's own namespace
                    prop.entityTypeName += ':#' + namespace;
                }
                // coerce ...keyNames to array
                var keyNames = prop.foreignKeyNames;
                if (keyNames && !_isArray(keyNames)) {
                    prop.foreignKeyNames = [keyNames];
                }
                keyNames = prop.invForeignKeyNames;
                if (keyNames && !_isArray(keyNames)) {
                    prop.invForeignKeyNames = [keyNames];
                }
            }
        };
    }


### attribute abbreviations

Some of the metadata attributes are a bit long winded. Fortunately, you often can abbreviate the more common attributes and `patchDefaults` will translate to the offical Breeze attribute names.

Here are some examples:

- Use `name` instead of `shortName` for an EntityType 
 
- For data properties 
  - `type` becomes `dataType`
  - variations on `null` become `isNullable`
  - `max` on a string property becomes `maxLength`
  - variations on `key` become `isPartOfKey`
  - `default` becomes `defaultValue`

- For navigation properties 
  - `type` becomes `entityTypeName`
  - `FK` or `FKs` becomes `foreignKeyNames`
  - `invFK` or `invFKs` becomes `invForeignKeyNames`
  - `assoc` becomes `associationName`

### array coercion

The `validators` attribute should be assigned an array of validators. It's easy to forget the array brackets when you only have one validator. `patchDefault` will coerce that into a one-element array for you.

The `foreignKeyNames` and `invForeignKeyNames` attributes should be assigned an array of foreign key property names. In practice, navigation properties are almost always backed by exactly one FK property. If you omit the array brackets, `patchDefault` will coerce the string value for the FK property name into a one-element string array for you.

<a name="ProductRevisited"></a> 

### example

Here's how abbreviations and array coercion might simplify the `Product` type definition we saw earlier.

    function addProductType(store) {
        var et = {
            name: "Product",
            defaultResourceName: "Products",
            autoGeneratedKeyType: Identity, 
    
            dataProperties: {
                productID:       { type: DT.Int32, key: true },
                productName:     { max: 40 },
                supplierID:      { type: DT.Int32} ,
                categoryID:      { type: DT.Int32 },
                unitPrice:       { type: DT.Decimal },
                unitsInStock:    { type: DT.Int16 },
                discontinued:    { type: DT.Boolean, nullOk: false },
                discontinuedDate:{ type: DT.DateTime },
                // other properties
            },
    
            navigationProperties: {
                category: {
                    type: "Category",
                    assoc: "Product_Category",
                    fk: "categoryID" 
                },
                supplier: {
                    type: "Supplier",
                    assoc: "Supplier_Products",
                    fk: "supplierID" 
                },
            }
        };
    
        return addTypeToStore(store, et);
    }

<a name="inferValidators"></a>
 
## inferValidators

A property that is not nullable is probably required. The property should have a `required` validator. When we set a property value and the property has a data type, we probably want to confirm that the value matches the data type. The property should have the appropriate data type validator.
If we specified a `maxLength` for a string property, the property should carry the `maxLength` validator.

The developer shouldn't have to specify these validators when we can infer them so easily. The `inferValidators` method takes carry of this.

> Breeze infers these validators automatically when it processes metadata received from the server. We're writing metadata by hand on the client so we have to do it ourselves.

    function inferValidators(entityType) {
    
        entityType.dataProperties.forEach(function (prop) {
            if (!prop.isNullable) { // is required. 
                addValidator(prop, Validator.required());
            };
    
            addValidator(prop, getDataTypeValidator(prop));
    
            if (prop.maxLength != null && prop.dataType === DT.String) {
                addValidator(prop, Validator.maxLength({ maxLength: prop.maxLength }));
            }
    
        });
    
        return entityType;
    
        function addValidator(prop, validator) {
            if (!validator) { return; } // no validator arg
            var valName = validator.name;
            var validators = prop.validators;
            var found = validators.filter(function (val) { return val.name == valName; })
            if (!found.length) { // this validator has not already been specified
                validators.push(validator);
            }
        }
    
        function getDataTypeValidator(prop) {
            var dataType = prop.dataType;
            var validatorCtor = !dataType || dataType === DT.String ? null : dataType.validatorCtor;
            return validatorCtor ? validatorCtor() : null;
        }
    }

The `getDataTypeValidator` is noteworthy in two respects.

1. Breeze's`dataType.validatorCtor` property tells us what `Validator` to use.
 
2. We can't use the data type `Validator` for a string property because we lack the length information that `Validator.string()` requires.

## addTypeNameAsResource

We often write Breeze queries that apply to the local cache. For example,

    var query = breeze.EntityQuery.from('Product')
                .where('categoryID', '==', someCategoryId);

    // query the cache synchronously
    var categoryProducts = manager.executeQueryLocally(query); 

Notice that this particular query addresses a resource named "Product". That seems natural and you might think that an `EntityType` name is always a valid resource name. 

It is not! At least it is not by default. Resource names are typically *server-side controller method names*. This application has a Web API controller that exposes a "Products" (plural) endpoint; it doesn't have a "Product" (singular) endpoint. Accordingly, the `Product` default resource name is "Products", not "Product".

Fortunately, we can associate the `Product` type with additional resources names ... such as the `EntityType` name. That's the point of the `addTypeNameAsResource` method:

    // Adds the type's 'shortName' as one of the resource names for the type.
    function addTypeNameAsResource(store, type) {
        if (!type.isComplexType) { // don't do this for ComplexTypes
            store.setEntityTypeForResourceName(type.shortName, type);
        }
    }

Note how this method excludes `ComplexType` names. A `ComplexType` is not an entity and is not directly queryable in the cache.

While we can associate an `EntityType` with as many resources names as we wish, we must make sure that a given resource name is associated with exactly one type! There is a remote possibility that our model has two types with the same short name but different namespaces. The way we call this method in `addTypeToStore`, we would unintentionally associate the same resource name with the two different types. We could fix that later by removing one or both of these "shortName" resources and optionally adding fullname resources.

# *You might want to know ...* 

In this section we talk about some corner cases.

### Define inline validators as strings 
Although the elements of a data property's `validators` array must be instances of the `Validator` class Breeze knows how to turn a JSON string representation of the validator into a `breeze.Validator` object.

We harnessed that trick in a helper function called within the `patchDefaults` helper:

    function convertValidators(typeName, propName, propDef) {
        ...
        propDef.validators.forEach(function (val, ix) {
            ...
            try {
                validators[ix]=breeze.Validator.fromJSON(val);
            } catch (ex) {
               ...
            }
        });
    }

The pertinent expression in there is

    breeze.Validator.fromJSON(val); // val is in JSON format

Using this technique, we could have written the `Supplier.phone` property definition as

    phone: { maxLength: 24, validators: [ {name: 'phone'} ] },

This `convertValidators` helper also coerces a single validator into a one-element array of validators as Breeze requires.

<a name="invForeignKeyNames"></a>

### Omitting a navigation property 

We usually have navigation properties on both sides of an association. The  "Supplier_Products" association, for example, is represented by both a `Suppler.products` and a `Product.supplier` navigation property.

Breeze needs foreign keys in order to maintain an association for reasons we <a href="#foreignKeyNames">explained above</a>. One of the navigation properties must identify the foreign key properties that support the association.  

Identifying the foreign keys is usually the job of the navigation property on the "dependent" type. Which end of the association is the "dependent type"? Looking again at "Supplier_Products" we see that

* The `Supplier` type is the "principal" in this association; we know that because it doesn't possess foreign key properties that point to `Product`.  

* The `Product` type **is** the "dependent" entity in this association because it *does hold the foreign key properties* that point to `Supplier`. 

By custom the `Product.supplier` property should identify the foreign key properties ... as it does with the navigation attribute: 

    foreignKeyNames: ["supplierID"] 

Now we don't have to define both navigation properties. We can omit a navigation property that we don't need or want. When there is only one navigation property we say that the association is "unidirectional".

That means the lone remaining navigation property must fulfill the requirement of identifying the pertinent foreign keys.

We could remove the `Supplier.products` property and keep the `Product.supplier` navigation. `Product.supplier` already identifies the foreign key properties so we don't have to do anything else.

> We could ditch the `associationName` as well; it's only required to associate *bi*-directional navigation properties. However, we prefer to retain the `associationName` for future proofing.

Imagine instead that we want to keep the `Supplier.products` property and remove the `Product.supplier` navigation. In so doing, we'd be removing the `foreignKeyNames` attribute that identifies the foreign keys.

Somebody has to identify the foreign keys. The `Supplier.products` property will have to do it. 

Unfortunately, we can't put the `foreignKeyNames` attribute on the `Supplier.products` property. `Supplier` is the "principal" entity in the association and it doesn't possess the association foreign key properties. The foreign key properties are physically on the "dependent" `Product` entity. So we apply the `invForeignKeyNames` attribute instead to make this difference clear.

    invForeignKeyNames: ["supplierID"] 
 
The "inv" prefix tells Breeze to look for the foreign keys on the *other* entity, the "inverse" `Product` entity.
