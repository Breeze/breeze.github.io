#PHP Employee Directory

Adrotec, the developers of [breeze.server.php](https://github.com/adrotec/breeze.server.php), created this [Employee Directory](http://emp-directory.herokuapp.com/) app to demonstrate the features of Breeze with a PHP backend.

On the client, the app demonstrates using Breeze to manage relationships between entities, track changes, perform validation, and save changes.  On the server, it demonstrates using [breeze.server.php](https://github.com/adrotec/breeze.server.php) to generate metadata, perform queries, save changes, and much more.  [Read more about the app here](http://emp-directory.herokuapp.com/).
