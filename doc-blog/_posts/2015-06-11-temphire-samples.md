# New TempHire Samples

New versions of the TempHire sample are now available. We've ported the Durandal TempHire sample to Android and also developed a nodejs back-end. Java is coming soon. The new TempHire samples are developed using a preliminary version of Angular 1.4, demonstrating the new router. Once Angular 1.4 is officially released, we will update the sample to the final version. There might still be some bugs currently that will hopefully be addressed by the time the final version is release.
