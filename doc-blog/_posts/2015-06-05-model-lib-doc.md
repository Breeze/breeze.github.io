# Model Library Documented

You likely built your application with one of the popular "model libraries" such as Angular, Aurelia, Durandal, Knockout or React. You may need to tell Breeze about your library choice by selecting a compatible "Model Library Adapter".

We added a new [documentation page](/doc-js/model-library) that explains the Model Library Adapter and how to pick the right one for your app.
