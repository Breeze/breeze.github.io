#The ASP.NET Web API controller

The Basic Breeze teaching tests in the [DocCode sample](/doc-samples/doccode "Breeze 'DocCode' teaching sample") demonstrate the Breeze `EntityManager` making requests of a **Breeze ASP.NET Web API controller**.

The [ASP.NET Web API](http://www.asp.net/web-api "Microsoft ASP.NET Web API ") is a framework for building HTTP services. Its simplicity has made it instantly popular with .NET backend developers who are used to struggling with Microsoft’s enormously complex, SOAP-based, WCF communications stack.

In a nutshell, the Web API routes an HTTP request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc) to an action method of a controller. The controller developer has easy access to the complete client request but is usually most interested in the URL query parameters or the body of the request. There's more to it of course but that's the gist of it.

The Breeze Controller is just one of many ways to serve a Breeze client with either .NET or non-Net technologies. It is among the easiest and most capable server stacks available to .Net developers. You'll see it driving many of the Breeze samples. 

#"*One controller to rule them all ...*"

When targeting a Breeze client, it is usually preferable to write a Web API **controller per *service***. 

The [DocCode teaching tests](/doc-samples/doccode "Breeze 'DocCode' teaching sample") target a couple of different "services" each with its own entity model. For example, some DocCode tests aim at the "Todos" model and other tests aim at the "Northwind" model.  The DocCode sample has two corresponding Web API controllers, `TodosController` and `NorthwindController`.

###Controller-per-type

You *could* adopt the customary *controller-per-**type*** implementation pattern: write one controller for `Customer`, another for `Order`, another for `Product`, etc. 

But this is tedious and usually unnecessary. As we'll see, Breeze can radically reduce the number of controller methods that you'll need for each type ... typically to one query method. Most Breeze clients combine the discrete entity insert, update, and delete operations into compound "change-sets" and send that change-set to a controller save method. The Breeze controller may only require a single save method to support an entire suite of entity types. 

>You can have multiple "save changes" methods to support "[named saves](/doc-js/saving-changes)"; here we're describing the simple case.

If you followed the *controller-per-type* approach, you'd be writing numerous controllers, each with a single method ... the query method. In our opinion, that's a maintenance burden without a compensating benefit. 

We recommend instead that you consolidate into one Web API controller *per service*. The notion of "service" typically is aligned with a "feature set" and corresponding business model ... just like our "Todos" and "Northwind" services.

#TodosController example

The "Todos" model only has one entity so its Web API controller is small, making it a good place for us to start. Here’s the `TodosController`:

	[BreezeController]
	public class TodosController : ApiController {

		readonly EFContextProvider<TodoDbContext> _contextProvider = 
			new EFContextProvider<TodoDbContext>();

		// ~/breeze/todos/Metadata 
		[HttpGet]
		public string Metadata() {
			return _contextProvider.Metadata();
		}

		// ~/breeze/todos/Todos
		// ~/breeze/todos/Todos?$filter=IsArchived eq false&$orderby=CreatedAt 
		[HttpGet]
		public IQueryable<TodoItem> Todos() {
			return _contextProvider.Context.Todos;
		}

		// ~/breeze/todos/SaveChanges
		[HttpPost]
		public SaveResult SaveChanges(JObject saveBundle) {
			return _contextProvider.SaveChanges(saveBundle);
		}
	}

#It's just a Web API Controller

A "Breeze Controller"  is just a Web API controller that has been extended to support a "happy path" for Breeze .NET developers.
 
Notice that there is no Breeze base class. The `TodosController` inherits directly from the `ApiController` Web API base class. A Breeze Controller fits into the Web API [router and action](http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/web-api-routing-and-actions) pipeline like other controllers. It works with the same [**Web API security schemes**](http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/security "Web API Security") as other controllers.

#BreezeControllerAttribute

A Breeze Web API controller and an out-of-the-box Breeze client share a common understanding about the nature and format of HTTP requests, responses, and payloads. The `BreezeControllerAttribute` configures the Web API pipeline to conform to that understanding. 

>Your Breeze Web API Controller may co-habitate with other, non-Breeze controllers that have different requirements. The `BreezeControllerAttribute` configuration applies to *this controller only*.

When the Web API routes a request to the `TodosController`, it creates a new instance of that controller type and then calls the `BreezeControllerAttribute` to configure the Web API pipeline for this controller. The attribute first removes filters that could interfere with behavior that the Breeze client expects (e.g, all `MediaTypeFormatters`). Then it adds its own `BreezeJsonFormatter` and substitutes the `BreezeQueryableAttribute` for the Web API's own `QueryableAttribute`.

>You could make these adjustments yourself instead of applying the `BreezeControllerAttribute`. But be careful: you also have to remove the Web API pipeline filters that interfere with Breeze. Unless you have a compelling reason to do otherwise it is best to keep it simple: **always decorate your Breeze controller with the `BreezeControllerAttribute`**.

#Serialization

The data that flow between Breeze clients and Web API controllers are formatted as JSON. A Web API formatter serializes .NET objects as JSON. Out-of-the box, the Web API installs a `JsonMediaTypeFormatter` as the global default formatter ... but this formatter isn't configured optimally for Breeze clients.

A Breeze controller uses this same `JsonMediaTypeFormatter` *class* for its client/server communications but replaces the default formatter *instance* with one that is setup for Breeze clients; see the `Breeze.WebApi.JsonFormatter` class for details.

###Customize the JsonMediaTypeFormatter

The Breeze formatter settings are prescribed in the `BreezeConfig.CreateJsonSerializerSettings` method. You can modify these settings to suit your needs as long as you avoid settings that that would confuse the Breeze client.

For example, the default method tells the formatter to send null values: if the "Description" property value is null, the formatter will still send the property. It would be a pretty small optimization if you wanted to suppress this behavior.  We **don't** actually recommend this because most of the time the price of sending null values is a negligible increase in payload size, And ... It's an optimization that may not work well in your application; a value of null often has a very specific meaning ( as opposed to not being sent at all). 

All that said, you can change it so that null values *are excluded* in the serialized output sent to the client.

	public class CustomBreezeConfig : Breeze.ContextProvider.BreezeConfig {

		///<summary> Disable sending of null values to the client. </summary>
		protected override JsonSerializerSettings CreateJsonSerializerSettings() { 
			var baseSettings = base.CreateJsonSerializerSettings(); 
			baseSettings.NullValueHandling = NullValueHandling.Ignore; // DON'T SEND NULL VALUES
			return baseSettings; 
		} 
	}

You don't have to register the `CustomBreezeConfig` class with Breeze. Breeze will discover it in your Web API controller assembly and use the custom class instead of its own. Please note that you may have only one `BreezeConfig` sub-class per assembly.

**Important**: you are responsible for ensuring that your changes do not conflict with Breeze client expectations. Test your changes thoroughly. If you're not sure, ask us first (e.g., on [StackOverflow tagged with "breeze"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/breeze?sort=newest "StackOverflow tagged with 'breeze'")).

>**Do not** reconfigure the formatter to use camel casing on the client. Use the BreezeJS  [`NamingConvention`](/doc-js/metadata#NamingConvention) instead.

#BreezeQueryableAttribute

The `BreezeQueryableAttribute` converts Breeze client query URLs into LINQ expressions ... much as the [Web API `QueryableAttribute`](http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/odata-support-in-aspnet-web-api/supporting-odata-query-options) does.

Breeze clients query for data by sending HTTP GET requests to the controller formatted as [OData Query URLs](http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-3-0/url-conventions/ "OData URL conventions"). For example, a client could query for active (non-archived) Todos, sorted by creation date, with this URL.

    .../breeze/todos/Todos?$filter=IsArchived eq false&$orderby=CreatedAt 

The Web API router finds a corresponding controller GET action method ... which is the `Todos` method of our `TodosController`:

    [HttpGet]
    public IQueryable<TodoItem> Todos() {
    	return _contextProvider.Context.Todos;
    }

The `BreezeQueryableAttribute` translates the URL Query parameters into a revision of the LINQ `IQueryable` returned by controller method, resulting in LINQ query expressions such as this one:

    Todos.Where(t => t.IsArchived == false).OrderBy('CreatedAt');

Then the Web API takes over, executes the query (invoking the query's LINQ provider), and serializes the query results back to the client.

The `BreezeControllerAttribute` automatically applies a `BreezeQueryableAttribute` to every controller GET method that returns an `IQueryable`.

You don't have to add the attribute to each controller method yourself ... unless you want to do something special with that method.

<a name="limiting-query-options"></a>
###Limiting query options

You may want to constrain what a particular query can do. In standard Web API, you'd add a `QueryableAttribute` to the controller method and specify the [limiting query options](http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/odata-support-in-aspnet-web-api/supporting-odata-query-options "limiting query options").

You can do the same thing with the `BreezeQueryableAttribute`. For example, you can restrict a query to allow only $skip and $top, to support paging and nothing else

    [BreezeQueryable(AllowedQueryOptions=
        AllowedQueryOptions.Skip | AllowedQueryOptions.Top)]

The `BreezeQueryableAttribute` derives from the `QueryableAttribute`, adding capabilities not yet implemented in the Web API. You can still use all of the features of the base `QueryableAttribute` class.

>We are aware that Web API's `QueryableAttribute` has been deprecated in favor of `EnableQueryAttribute` in Web API v.1.5. Please stick with `BreezeQueryable` until we've had a chance to write a corresponding derived attribute for `EnableQuery`.


> ***Always* use the `BreezeQueryable` attribute. DO NOT USE the Web API's `Queryable` attribute!** The latter overwrites Breeze’s JSON.Net configuration so the client may not be able to interpret the JSON query result correctly.

#EFContextProvider

Many .NET server developers turn to the Microsoft's [Entity Framework](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/ef.aspx) for relational data modeling and relational data access. It's so popular that Breeze offers a special [`EFContextProvider` class](/doc-net/ef-efcontextprovider) to facilitate development of .NET servers for Breeze clients.

This provider encapsulates three main functions:

1. Instantiation of a context for accessing the data store
1. Generation (or acquisition) of metadata to send to Breeze clients
1. Processing "change-set" save requests

The `TodosController` defines a `_contextProvider` field, initialized to a fresh instance of `EFContextProvider<T>`.:

    readonly EFContextProvider<TodoDbContext> _contextProvider =
        new EFContextProvider<TodoDbContext>();

`EFContextProvider<T>` is a generic class that wraps a single EF model’s `DbContext`.

>If you wrote an EF "database first" model rather than a "code first" model, you *may* have an `ObjectContext` instead of a `DbContext`. Pass your `ObjectContext` as the type parameter instead of a `DbContext`.

###Better style

Your controller could instantiate an out-of-the-box `EFContextProvider` from Breeze exactly as we show here. 

We don't do that in real world code. The approach you see here is fine for demos but it isn't clean, robust or testable.

1. The controller and the context are separate concerns and we prefer to define them in separate classes. We'd start by sub-classing `EFContextProvider<TodoDbContext>` as `TodoContext`.

1. We prefer that the controller work with a higher level abstraction such as a "repository" class than work directly with a context provider. We might write a `TodoRepository` that instantiates the `TodoContext` and have it implement `ITodoRepository` for improved testability.

1. We'd make our controllers easier to test by injecting the `ITodoRepository` rather than "new-ing" the concrete `TodoRepository`. The Web API is [friendly to dependency injection](http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/extensibility/using-the-web-api-dependency-resolver).

###Alternatives to Entity Framework

The `EFContextProvider` derives from the Breeze [`ContextProvider`](/doc-net/ef-efcontextprovider "ContextProvider") which can be the base class for alternative providers that don't involve Entity Framework ... and don't store data in a relational database either. 

Breeze ships [components for NHibernate](/doc-net/nh-details) developers.  The [in-memory "No DB" sample](/doc-samples/no-db) has a custom `ContextProvider` that doesn't write to a database. The source for any of these providers can guide you in writing your own provider.

But back to our story .. and the first of the "Breeze Controller"  specialty methods.

##The Metadata controller method

The Breeze JavaScript client requires metadata to query the service, create new entities, and save changes. These metadata describe the client-side entity model and how to translate it into the service model that is understood by the persistence service.

As we saw earlier, it takes a fair amount of [metadata](/doc-js/metadata) to adequately describe a model. Fortunately, an `EFContextProvider` tell Entity Framework to generate metadata for the Breeze client so that the JavaScript developer doesn’t have to [write it by hand](/doc-js/metadata-by-hand). 

The Breeze client requests metadata from the server by calling upon the controller's `Metadata` method.

    // ~/breeze/todos/Metadata 
    [HttpGet]
    public string Metadata() {   
        return _contextProvider.Metadata(); // delegate to the ContextProvider
    }

##A query controller method

The `TodosController` has only one model type so it has just one query method

    // ~/breeze/todos/Todos
    // ~/breeze/todos/Todos?$filter=IsArchived eq false&$orderby=CreatedAt 
    [HttpGet]
    public IQueryable<TodoItem> Todos() {
        return _contextProvider.Context.Todos;
    }

This method returns an `IQueryable` of an entity type in the model, the `TodoItem` type in this case. 

The `IQueryable<TodoItem>` is important. It means that this action does not return data!  Instead, it returns a LINQ query object that can be extended with additional query parameters to filter, order, page, project, and expand the query results. A comment shows two URL examples that Web API would route to this method. The first gets all `TodoItems`; the second returns non-archived `TodoItems`, sorted by creation date. 

The Web API executes the query after the `BreezeQueryableAttribute` applies these parameters to the LINQ expression (the `IQueryable`) returned by the method [as we discussed above](#breeze-queryable).

Thanks to the power and flexibility of OData query syntax, a single controller action method can satisfy all of this particular application’s `TodoItem` query requirements. We don’t have to write a separate query action method for every application query request.

###Query actions per entity type

The "Todos" model only has one entity so the `TodosController` only has one query action.  The "Northwind" model exposes many more entity types … and its `NorthwindController` has corresponding query actions, implemented in the same manner, as seen in this elided extract:

    BreezeController]
    public class NorthwindController : ApiController {

      [HttpGet]
      public IQueryable<Customer> Customers() {
    	return _contextProvider.Context.Customers;
      }
    
      [HttpGet]
      public IQueryable<Order> Orders() {
    	return _contextProvider.Context.Orders;
      }
    
      [HttpGet]
      public IQueryable<OrderDetail> OrderDetails() {
    	return _contextProvider.Context.OrderDetails;
      }
    
      [HttpGet]
      public IQueryable<Product> Products() {
    	return _contextProvider.Context.Products;
      }
    }

### Client-initiated "eager" queries

You do not have to publish a query method for every entity type. For example, you might choose not to publish an `OrderDetails` action; `OrderDetail` entities belong exclusively to their parent `Orders`. You might feel that a client should only access them through their parent orders.

How do you get the `OrderDetails` to the client if there is no controller action for them? Using OData "expand". Here's an example Breeze JS client query:

    breeze.EntityQuery.from('Orders')
          .where('CustomerID', '==', alfredsID)
          .expand('OrderDetails') // <--- gets OrderDetails of "Alfreds" orders
          .using(manager).execute()
          .then(successCallback).catch(failCallback); 

On the server, the `BreezeQueryableAttribute` adds an Entity Framework "include" clause. The executed LINQ query returns the "Alfreds" order and that order's line items in the same payload.

After eagerly fetching the related order line items with this query, the client can navigate from an order to its details (e.g, in Knockout you could write `someOrder.OrderDetails()`) without first loading those details in a separate step.

### Specialized query methods

Suppose you don't want to expose an "OrderDetails" controller method and you don't want clients to send query requests with the "expand" clause. You can write a specialized controller query method that internally includes the `OrderDetails` in the payload automatically:

    [HttpGet]
    public IQueryable<Order> OrdersAndDetails()
    {
        return _contextProvider.Context.Orders.Include('OrderDetails');
    }

This time the client queries for orders by targeting the “OrdersAndDetails” endpoint. The method ensures that the line items come along for the ride. The client developer can still filter and page the orders, but he doesn’t have to specify the expansion.

    breeze.EntityQuery
	      .from('OrdersAndDetails')  // <--- Specify the "OrdersAndDetails" resource
          .where('CustomerID', '==', alfredsID)
          .using(manager).execute()
          .then(successCallback).catch(failCallback); 

This example is probably not a great case for a specialized query action. It’s easy to put the “expand” on the client query rather than clutter up the controller with extra actions. But the technique is worth knowing because someday you will have a query that *should be* or *can only be* written on the server.

#The SaveChanges method

When the Breeze client calls `saveChanges()`, the `EntityManager` posts a bundle of JSON entity changes to the controller’s `SaveChanges` method. 

The bundle could contain a mix of different types (`Customer`, `Order`, `OrderDetail`) and different operations (add, update, delete). They all travel together in the body of the POST.

The Web API delivers the bundle to the controller’s `SaveChanges` method as a JSON object (`JObject`). You could unpack that bundle yourself but it is far more convenient to let the `_contextProvider.SaveChanges` method handle that … and save those changes in EF as a single transaction:

    [HttpPost]
    public SaveResult SaveChanges(JObject saveBundle) {
      return _contextProvider.SaveChanges(saveBundle);
    }

### Server-side Validation

Are alarm bells ringing when you read this code? We shouldn't blithely save everything the client tells us to save. We should inspect every request, making sure that the changes are valid and that the user is authorized to make them.

Learn how to do that with [a custom EFContextProvider and save interception](/doc-net/ef-efcontextprovider#SaveInterception).
