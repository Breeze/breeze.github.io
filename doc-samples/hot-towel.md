	Hot Towel SPA template</h1>
<p><br />
	Hot Towel is an <a href="http://www.asp.net/single-page-application/overview/templates/hottowel-template" target="_blank">ASP.NET 4 project for a single page application</a> built with Knockout, Durandal, and Breeze.<br />
	<br />
	Out of the box, it provides a modular structure for your code, view navigation, data binding, rich data management and simple but elegant styling. Hot Towel provides everything you need to build a SPA, so you can focus on your app, not the plumbing.</p>
<p>Hot Towel was written by John Papa who describes it vividly <a href="http://www.johnpapa.net/hottowel/" target="_blank">on his blog</a>.</p>
