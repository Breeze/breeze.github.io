#***to$q*** - a bridge to Angular promises

A BreezeJS asynchronous method returns a promise, typically a promise to deliver some data from a remote service (or an error if the service request fails).

<p class="note">The <em>to$q</em> has been deprecated. It is superseded by the <a href="/doc-js/breeze-angular" title="Breeze Angular Service"><strong>Breeze Angular Service</strong></a>.</p>
