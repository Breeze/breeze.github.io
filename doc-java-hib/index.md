# Java with Hibernate

Prefer Java? You're in luck, Breeze works for you too.

Our first step in this area was to provide support for Hibernate and SQL databases. 

As we move forward we plan to provide additional Breeze adapters. We watch UserVoice to judge demand, so thanks for voting for Java/Hibernate.

In the event that we haven't gotten to your preferred backend, we also provide consulting services to write custom versions of these adapters.
