Breeze helps you manage data in rich client applications.  It gives you ORM-like data management capability in a JavaScript application.  If you store data in a database, query and save those data as complex object graphs, and share these graphs across multiple screens of your JavaScript client, Breeze is for you.

The [breeze.server.java](https://github.com/Breeze/breeze.server.java) libraries make it easy to write Java servers that work with [Breeze clients](/doc-js/).  They currently support Hibernate, with JPA coming soon.  See the [Introduction](introduction.html) page for more about its capabilities.
