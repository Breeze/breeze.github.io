#  Java Coding&nbsp;and API conventions

The Breeze client components adhere to a small number of conventions that cut across the entire API. The page describing those conventions is not ready for publication. It will cover:</p>
                   
+ Naming conventions
+ Promises, a technique for managing chains of asynchronous method calls
+ Why Breeze properties do not have setters and you should call *setProperty* instead
+ *Enum*, Breeze constants as rich, extensible objects
+ *Event*, publish and subscribe in Breeze
+ Breeze client configuration options
+ Bypassing the entity property API to get and set data values
